# AI-Powered TV Series Analyzer

This project is an interactive web application that uses multiple NLP models to perform an in-depth analysis of a TV series. The system can scrape custom data, analyze character relationships, classify text, and identify narrative themes, all presented through a user-friendly Gradio interface.

## Features

**Custom Text Classification:** Fine-tunes a DistilBERT model on data acquired via a Scrapy web crawler to classify domain-specific text (e.g., classifying ninja attack types in Naruto).

**Character Network Analysis:** Uses SpaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NetworkX/PyViz to build and visualize an interactive graph of character relationships and interaction strength.

**Dynamic Theme Analysis:** Applies a Zero-Shot classification model to identify and score the prevalence of various user-defined themes throughout the series dialogue.
